# Qt Practice Prorjects

* Some Qt practice projects about QThread, QThreadPool, Qt Network, QTcpSocket, QUdpSocket usage. 
* These are mainly based on tutorials from VoidRealms[1] youtube channel. 
* Built a simple windows app that sends message between two users using UDP packages. 
<br/>

## Install Qt 
* Followed intructions from VoidRealms[1]. 
* Need registration to download Qt from [Qt website](https://www.qt.io/). 
* Chose Qt for Open Source Development. [Open Source Usage Obligations](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source?hsCtaTracking=9f6a2170-a938-42df-a8e2-a9f0b1d6cdce%7C6cb0de4f-9bb5-4778-ab02-bfb62735f3e5).
* In the future if want to add packages can use Qt MaintenanceTool to add them. 
* There are some other resources that demonstrate how to install and use openCV with QT. <br/><br/>
